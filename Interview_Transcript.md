# Interview Transcript – Microsoft Teams AI Assistant Project

### Question 1
**Can you describe a typical workday in Microsoft Teams — what kinds of tasks or communications take up most of your time?**

**Interviewee:**  
A typical workday for me on Microsoft Teams mainly involves checking the class that I’m in for psychology. I only have two groups on Microsoft Teams — my Intro to Psychology class and the Psychology Major group. I mostly access files for the class that I need to complete my assignments, and I rarely text or communicate with others there.


### Question 2
**When working across Teams, Outlook, and SharePoint, what situations make it difficult to stay organized or keep track of what needs to be done?**

**Interviewee:**  
For me, switching between tabs is what makes personal organization difficult. When I’m trying to keep track of information, it’s often spread out — some is only shown in my email, some within Teams, and some on the Grinnell College SharePoint.  

I often need to keep track of multiple pieces of information at the same time to make sure I get everything done. For example, if I have an email that contains part of the instructions for an assignment, I’ll pull that email up on part of my screen. But in order to access the actual file to complete the assignment, I need to look at my files section in Teams, which takes extra navigation. Additionally, I might need to go to SharePoint to access different parts of my class or other related information.  

Navigating all of these different sites is a mental process I have to do myself, and it feels like extra work just to consolidate everything I need for the day.

### Question 3
**If an AI assistant could help you in Microsoft Teams, what specific tasks would you most want it to handle automatically?**

**Interviewee:**  
If an AI assistant could help me in Microsoft Teams, I’d want it to be able to, just from keywords or the title of an assignment, look through all my Teams chats or tabs — across different classes or groups that I’m part of — and immediately open the document I need.


### Question 4
**How comfortable would you feel if an AI had access to your Teams chats, emails, or shared documents to help automate your work?**

**Interviewee:**  
I would feel very uncomfortable if an AI had access to my Teams, Outlook emails, and documents — especially for school — because all of that information is relatively professional. I do have a computer with Copilot Plus, and technically, that Copilot already has access to a lot of the information I give it. It can access almost any screen that I’m on, unlike my regular computer, and I actually find that kind of access quite efficient. But I would still be cautious about letting an AI freely access my academic files or communications.


### Question 5
**Imagine it’s six months from now and the AI agent has become part of your daily workflow — what would a “perfect interaction” with it look like for you?**

**Interviewee:**  
I really trust Copilot and AI to help me manage everything related to work and school. I think a perfect interaction would be if I could open my computer and, instead of having to manually navigate to the assignment instructions, then to the document where I create a new file, and then set up all the information I need to complete the task — I could just ask it to do all of that.  

For example, I could say:  
> "Please open my psychology class, give me the instructions for the assignment that’s due in week five, and also open a Word document for me, get it ready to save in my Psychology folder, and help me summarize what this article is saying so that I can prepare to write a response."

That would save me at least ten minutes. If it could understand my school objectives, my work objectives, and how I organize and save things on my computer, it would really help me stay organized and save me the time I usually spend setting up everything myself.

### Question 1
**Can you describe a typical workday in Microsoft Teams — what kinds of tasks or communications take up most of your time?**

**Interviewee:**  
For me, I mainly use Microsoft Teams for my academic work — especially for my coursework. I’m currently a junior, and most of my classes now are major courses, such as mathematics and economics. Microsoft Teams helps me organize the files I need for these classes and the documents I use for assignments. It also helps me plan what tasks to do during specific time periods, which is very convenient. Overall, most of my time spent on Teams is related to my studies.


### Question 2
**When working across Teams, Outlook, and SharePoint, what situations make it difficult to stay organized or keep track of what needs to be done?**

**Interviewee:**  
I think the most difficult part for me is that my workflow is quite fixed — I can’t really use Chrome or easily switch to it, since Chrome is tied to Gmail, while Outlook and Teams are Microsoft products. Because of that, many tools or platforms don’t connect well with each other. It’s a bit inconvenient since the things I browse online or manage in Chrome aren’t synchronized or recorded within the Microsoft system.


### Question 3
**If an AI assistant could help you in Microsoft Teams, what specific tasks would you most want it to handle automatically?**

**Interviewee:**  
If I had AI assistance, I’d want it to help me organize my upcoming schedule and remind me of the assignments I need to submit. That would be very useful because it would let me clearly categorize my daily tasks and plan them in detail on a timeline. I’d also like the AI to list out all the key points or instructions for each assignment, so I can manage my workload more efficiently. That’s the main thing I’d want it to do.


### Question 4
**How comfortable would you feel if an AI had access to your Teams chats, emails, or shared documents to help automate your work?**

**Interviewee:**  
As long as it doesn’t involve any of my personal or private information, I’d be fine with it. For example, I wouldn’t want it to access things like my ID, my parents’ information, or anything personal. But I’d be comfortable letting it handle information related to my academic or work tasks.


### Question 5
**Imagine it’s six months from now and the AI agent has become part of your daily workflow — what would a “perfect interaction” with it look like for you?**

**Interviewee:**  
I think a perfect interaction would be one that doesn’t invade my personal privacy but greatly helps with my daily academic and work activities. It would help me plan my schedule, remind me to submit assignments, and summarize parts of my work — for example, pointing out areas in my assignments that might need improvement. That kind of support would be ideal for me. Otherwise, I don’t think there would be any major issues.

### Question 1
**Can you describe a typical workday in Microsoft Teams — what kinds of tasks or communications take up most of your time?**

**Interviewee:**  
Right now, I mainly use Microsoft Teams for my teaching assistant work. This semester, I also work in the lab. We usually use Teams to share files, read papers, and synchronize our completed work in the shared “Files” section.  

When we discuss schedules or collaborate on writing problems for students, we also share our drafts and materials there. So, the features I use most often are the chat section and file sharing.


### Question 2
**When working across Teams, Outlook, and other platforms, what situations make it difficult to stay organized or keep track of what needs to be done?**

**Interviewee:**  
In Teams, I haven’t really found a built-in to-do list or task schedule. Maybe that’s because most of my courses post assignments on different platforms, not directly inside Teams. For example, professors might post announcements or assignment details in Teams, but the actual submission link** is on another site, so it’s hard to stay organized or synchronize everything.  

Basically, Teams and other academic platforms don’t communicate well, so I have to manually track deadlines and submissions across multiple tools.


### Question 3
**If an AI assistant could help you in Microsoft Teams, what specific tasks would you most want it to handle automatically?**

**Interviewee:**  
I’d love for the AI to automatically extract assignments mentioned in messages and turn them into to-do items. In each to-do item, I want it to link directly to the file I need to edit or the place I need to submit it — so I can just click once and get to work, without opening extra tabs or searching again.  

I’d also like the AI to merge my calendar with these to-do items, so each task shows exactly when it’s due.  

In general, I feel Microsoft isn’t very convenient for managing tasks right now — I mostly use it for file sharing. But if the AI could organize all my received messages automatically and, when I open Teams, show me a summary of what I need to reply to or finish, that would save me a lot of time and help me avoid missing important messages.


### Question 4
**Imagine it’s six months from now and the AI agent has become part of your daily workflow — what would a “perfect interaction” with it look like for you?**

**Interviewee:**  
It would include all the features I mentioned earlier — especially **highlighting my to-do items and unread or unreplied messages**.  

Ideally, if I reply to someone saying, for example, “We’ll have a meeting tomorrow at 6:00 p.m.”, I want the AI to automatically create a calendar event for that meeting. I wouldn’t need to manually add it.  

Also, when Microsoft Teams is running in the background, I’d like the AI to **notify me when an event is coming up** — maybe through a desktop pop-up or an email reminder on my phone. That would make Teams feel much more intelligent and proactive.
