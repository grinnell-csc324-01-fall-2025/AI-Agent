### Question 2
When working across Teams, Outlook, and SharePoint, what situations make it difficult to stay organized or keep track of what needs to be done?


### Question 3
If an AI assistant could help you in Microsoft Teams, what specific tasks would you most want it to handle automatically?


### Question 4
How comfortable would you feel if an AI had access to your Teams chats, emails, or shared documents to help automate your work?


### Question 5
Imagine it’s six months from now and the AI agent has become part of your daily workflow — what would a “perfect interaction” with it look like for you?
