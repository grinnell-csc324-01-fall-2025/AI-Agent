# Prototyping: Overlay vs Dashboard

### What design questions did we intend to answer?

Our main design question was: **Which interface helps users better organize their morning work when their emails and files are spread across different tools: a floating Overlay or a dedicated Dashboard?**

Related sub‑questions:
- Does a small, in-context overlay give enough space and structure for planning?
- Does a full Dashboard view make it easier to see everything at once and prioritize?

### How did we design the prototype(s) and user activities to answer these questions?

We created two low-to-mid fidelity Figma mockups (no-code prototypes) using Figma Make:
- **Overlay**: A floating interface meant for quick access while staying in context.
- **Dashboard**: A dedicated screen with tabs for Gmail and Drive that showed everything in one place.

These prototypes focused on **layout and information organization**, not visual polish, so we could isolate how the two structures affected users’ ability to plan their morning.

To connect the prototypes to our design questions, we asked a single participant to **plan their morning** using each design, while talking through what they were thinking. Using the same task across both prototypes let us directly compare:
- How easily they could find relevant emails and files.
- How clearly they could see “what needs to get done.”
- Which design they preferred and why.

### What answers did our prototyping efforts unveil?

From these sessions:
- The **Overlay** was **too constrained** for planning across multiple emails and files. It worked better for quick checks than for full morning planning.
- The **Dashboard** better supported **sense-making and planning** because it gave a single, centralized view and made it easier to understand and prioritize work.

From this single interview, the prototyping work answered our initial question: **for morning planning when information is scattered across tools, a dedicated Dashboard is a better fit than a floating Overlay.**
