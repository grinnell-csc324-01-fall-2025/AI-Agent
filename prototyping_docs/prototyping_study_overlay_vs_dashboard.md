# Prototyping & Evaluation: Overlay vs Dashboard

## Prototyping

### What design questions did we intend to answer?

Our main design question was: **Which interface helps users better organize their morning work when their emails and files are spread across different tools: a floating Overlay or a dedicated Dashboard?**

Related sub‑questions:
- Does a small, in-context overlay give enough space and structure for planning?
- Does a full Dashboard view make it easier to see everything at once and prioritize?

### How did we design the prototype(s) and user activities to answer these questions?

We created two low-to-mid fidelity Figma mockups (no-code prototypes) using Figma Make:
- **Overlay**: A floating interface meant for quick access while staying in context.
- **Dashboard**: A dedicated screen with tabs for Gmail and Drive that showed everything in one place.

These prototypes focused on **layout and information organization**, not visual polish, so we could isolate how the two structures affected users’ ability to plan their morning.

To connect the prototypes to our design questions, we asked participants to **plan their morning** using each design, while talking through what they were thinking. Using the same task across both prototypes let us directly compare:
- How easily they could find relevant emails and files.
- How clearly they could see “what needs to get done.”
- Which design they preferred and why.

### What answers did our prototyping efforts unveil?

From these sessions:
- The **Overlay** was **too constrained** for planning across multiple emails and files. It worked better for quick checks than for full morning planning.
- The **Dashboard** better supported **sense-making and planning** because it gave a single, centralized view and made it easier to understand and prioritize work.

This prototyping work answered our initial question: **for morning planning when information is scattered across tools, a dedicated Dashboard is a better fit than a floating Overlay.**

## Evaluation

### What was the design of the user study to evaluate the artifact?

We ran **short, moderated usability sessions**:
- Participants used **both** prototypes (Overlay and Dashboard).
- The main task was: **“Plan your morning using this tool”**—deciding what to focus on in their emails and files.
- We asked them to **think aloud** so we could understand where they were confused or confident.

We evaluated the designs against common usability dimensions:
- **Learnability**: how quickly they understood what each interface was for.
- **Efficiency**: how easily they could locate and organize the information they needed.
- **Visibility and organization**: how well the layout surfaced what mattered for planning.
- **Satisfaction and preference**: which design they liked more and why.

### What were the results of this user study?

The results matched what we saw during prototyping:
- **Overlay**:
  - Good for **quick, focused checks**, but
  - Too small and cramped for organizing multiple items; users struggled to see the big picture.
- **Dashboard**:
  - Better for **centralized planning**; participants could scan across emails and files and prioritize more confidently.
  - Felt like a more appropriate “home base” for starting their day.

Most participants **preferred the Dashboard** overall because it made morning planning feel clearer and less fragmented.

### What were the main points of future development?

From this evaluation, our main future-development points were:
- **Double down on the Dashboard** as the primary planning surface for organizing work across tools.
- **Refine the Overlay** (if kept) for **lightweight, quick actions** rather than full planning.
- **Iterate on Dashboard information hierarchy** to better highlight the most important emails/files and next actions.

Overall, the evaluation confirmed that the Dashboard is the stronger candidate design for our use case, and it clarified how the Overlay might be positioned as a supporting, not primary, interface.
