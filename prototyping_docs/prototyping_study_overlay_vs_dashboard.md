# Prototyping Study: Overlay vs Dashboard

## Design Question

We wanted to decide between a floating Overlay interface and a dedicated Dashboard. The main question was which design better helped users organize their morning when their emails and files were spread across different tools.

## Prototypes

We created two simple Figma mockups:

- **Overlay**: A floating interface meant for quick access while staying in context.
- **Dashboard**: A dedicated screen with tabs for Gmail and Drive that showed everything in one place.

These were low-to-mid fidelity and focused on layout and information organization, not visual polish.

## Study Setup

We ran short, moderated usability sessions. Participants were asked to plan their morning using each prototype while talking through what they were thinking. We observed how they navigated, where they got stuck, and which design they preferred.

## Results

Users felt the Overlay was too constrained for organizing multiple emails and files. It worked for quick checks but not for planning. Most users preferred the Dashboard because it gave them a single, centralized view that made it easier to understand and prioritize their work.

## Decision

Based on this feedback, we chose the Dashboard design since it better supported sense-making and planning.
